Version 1.3, 3 November 2008

Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.
2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.
3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

    A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
    B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.
    C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.
    D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
    E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.
    F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
    G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
    H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
    I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
    J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
    K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
    L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
    M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.
    N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
    O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled "History" in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".
6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.
8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.
9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.
10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See https://www.gnu.org/licenses/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.
11. RELICENSING

"Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

"CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.

"Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.

An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.

The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page:

    Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover Texts.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".

If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the "with … Texts." line with this:

    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.

If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.

Licence Publique Générale GNU

Les licences de la plupart des logiciels sont conçues pour vous enlever toute liberté de les partager et de les modifier.

A contrario, la Licence Publique Générale est destinée à garantir votre liberté de partager et de modifier les logiciels libres, et à assurer que ces logiciels soient libres pour tous leurs utilisateurs.

La présente Licence Publique Générale s'applique à la plupart des logiciels de la Free Software Foundation, ainsi qu'à tout autre programme pour lequel ses auteurs s'engagent à l'utiliser.

(Certains autres logiciels de la Free Software Foundation sont couverts par la GNU Lesser General Public License à la place.)

Vous pouvez aussi l'appliquer aux programmes qui sont les vôtres.

Quand nous parlons de logiciels libres, nous parlons de liberté, non de prix.

Nos licences publiques générales sont conçues pour vous donner l'assurance d'être libres de distribuer des copies des logiciels libres (et de facturer ce service, si vous le souhaitez), de recevoir le code source ou de pouvoir l'obtenir si vous le souhaitez, de pouvoir modifier les logiciels ou en utiliser des éléments dans de nouveaux programmes libres et de savoir que vous pouvez le faire.

Pour protéger vos droits, il nous est nécessaire d'imposer des limitations qui interdisent à quiconque de vous refuser ces droits ou de vous demander d'y renoncer.

Certaines responsabilités vous incombent en raison de ces limitations si vous distribuez des copies de ces logiciels, ou si vous les modifiez.

Par exemple, si vous distribuez des copies d'un tel programme, à titre gratuit ou contre une rémunération, vous devez accorder aux destinataires tous les droits dont vous disposez.

Vous devez vous assurer qu'eux aussi reçoivent ou puissent disposer du code source.

Et vous devez leur montrer les présentes conditions afin qu'ils aient connaissance de leurs droits.

Nous protégeons vos droits en deux étapes : (1) nous sommes titulaires des droits d'auteur du logiciel, et (2) nous vous délivrons cette licence, qui vous donne l'autorisation légale de copier, distribuer et/ou modifier le logiciel.

En outre, pour la protection de chaque auteur ainsi que la nôtre, nous voulons nous assurer que chacun comprenne que ce logiciel libre ne fait l'objet d'aucune garantie.

Si le logiciel est modifié par quelqu'un d'autre puis transmis à des tiers, nous voulons que les destinataires soient mis au courant que ce qu'ils ont reçu n'est pas le logiciel d'origine, de sorte que tout problème introduit par d'autres ne puisse entacher la réputation de l'auteur originel.

En définitive, un programme libre restera à la merci des brevets de logiciels.

Nous souhaitons éviter le risque que les redistributeurs d'un programme libre fassent des demandes individuelles de licence de brevet, ceci ayant pour effet de rendre le programme propriétaire.

Pour éviter cela, nous établissons clairement que toute licence de brevet doit être concédée de façon à ce que l'usage en soit libre pour tous ou bien qu'aucune licence ne soit concédée.

Les termes exacts et les conditions de copie, distribution et modification sont les suivants:
Conditions de copie, distribution et modification de la Licence Publique Générale GNU.

0. La présente Licence s'applique à tout programme ou tout autre ouvrage contenant un avis, apposé par le titulaire des droits d'auteur, stipulant qu'il peut être distribué au titre des conditions de la présente Licence Publique Générale.

Ci-après, le "Programme" désigne l'un quelconque de ces programmes ou ouvrages, et un "ouvrage fondé sur le Programme" désigne soit le Programme, soit un ouvrage qui en dérive au titre des lois sur le droit d'auteur : en d'autres termes, un ouvrage contenant le Programme ou une partie de ce dernier, soit à l'identique, soit avec des modifications et/ou traduit dans un autre langage.

(Ci-après, le terme "modification" implique, sans s'y réduire, le terme traduction)

Chaque concessionaire sera désigné par "vous".

Les activités autres que la copie, la distribution et la modification ne sont pas couvertes par la présente Licence ; elles sont hors de son champ d'application.

L'opération consistant à exécuter le Programme n'est soumise à aucune limitation et les sorties du programme ne sont couvertes que si leur contenu constitue un ouvrage fondé sur le Programme (indépendamment du fait qu'il ait été réalisé par l'exécution du Programme).

La validité de ce qui précède dépend de ce que fait le Programme.

1. Vous pouvez copier et distribuer des copies à l'identique du code source du Programme tel que vous l'avez reçu, sur n'importe quel support, du moment que vous apposiez sur chaque copie, de manière ad hoc et parfaitement visible, l'avis de droit d'auteur adéquat et une exonération de garantie ; que vous gardiez intacts tous les avis faisant référence à la présente Licence et à l'absence de toute garantie ; et que vous fournissiez à tout destinataire du Programme autre que vous-même un exemplaire de la présente Licence en même temps que le Programme.

Vous pouvez faire payer l'acte physique de transmission d'une copie, et vous pouvez, à votre discrétion, proposer une garantie contre rémunération.

2. Vous pouvez modifier votre copie ou des copies du Programme ou n'importe quelle partie de celui-ci, créant ainsi un ouvrage fondé sur le Programme, et copier et distribuer de telles modifications ou ouvrage selon les termes de l'Article 1 ci-dessus, à condition de vous conformer également à chacune des obligations suivantes :

a) Vous devez munir les fichiers modifiés d'avis bien visibles stipulants que vous avez modifié ces fichiers, ainsi que la date de chaque modification ;

b) Vous devez prendre les dispositions nécessaires pour que tout ouvrage que vous distribuez ou publiez, et qui, en totalité ou en partie, contient ou est fondé sur le Programme - ou une partie quelconque de ce dernier - soit concédé comme un tout, à titre gratuit, à n'importe quel tiers, au titre des conditions de la présente Licence.

c) Si le programme modifié lit habituellement des instructions de façon interactive lorsqu'on l'exécute, vous devez, quand il commence son exécution pour ladite utilisation interactive de la manière la plus usuelle, faire en sorte qu'il imprime ou affiche une annonce comprenant un avis de droit d'auteur ad hoc, et un avis stipulant qu'il n'y a pas de garantie (ou bien indiquant que c'est vous qui fournissez la garantie), et que les utilisateurs peuvent redistribuer le programme en respectant les présentes obligations, et expliquant à l'utilisateur comment voir une copie de la présente Licence.

(Exception : si le Programme est lui-même interactif mais n'imprime pas habituellement une telle annonce, votre ouvrage fondé sur le Programme n'est pas obligé d'imprimer une annonce).

Ces obligations s'appliquent à l'ouvrage modifié pris comme un tout.

Si des éléments identifiables de cet ouvrage ne sont pas fondés sur le Programme et peuvent raisonnablement être considérés comme des ouvrages indépendants distincts en eux mêmes, alors la présente Licence et ses conditions ne s'appliquent pas à ces éléments lorsque vous les distribuez en tant qu'ouvrages distincts.

Mais lorsque vous distribuez ces mêmes éléments comme partie d'un tout, lequel constitue un ouvrage fondé sur le Programme, la distribution de ce tout doit être soumise aux conditions de la présente Licence, et les autorisations qu'elle octroie aux autres concessionnaires s'étendent à l'ensemble de l'ouvrage et par conséquent à chaque et toute partie indifférement de qui l'a écrite.

Par conséquent, l'objet du présent article n'est pas de revendiquer des droits ou de contester vos droits sur un ouvrage entièrement écrit par vous; son objet est plutôt d'exercer le droit de contrôler la distribution d'ouvrages dérivés ou d'ouvrages collectifs fondés sur le Programme.

De plus, la simple proximité du Programme avec un autre ouvrage qui n'est pas fondé sur le Programme (ou un ouvrage fondé sur le Programme) sur une partition d'un espace de stockage ou un support de distribution ne place pas cet autre ouvrage dans le champ d'application de la présente Licence.

3. Vous pouvez copier et distribuer le Programme (ou un ouvrage fondé sur lui, selon l'Article 2) sous forme de code objet ou d'exécutable, selon les termes des Articles 1 et 2 ci-dessus, à condition que vous accomplissiez l'un des points suivants :

a) L'accompagner de l'intégralité du code source correspondant, sous une forme lisible par un ordinateur, lequel doit être distribué au titre des termes des Articles 1 et 2 ci-dessus, sur un support habituellement utilisé pour l'échange de logiciels; ou,

b) L'accompagner d'une proposition écrite, valable pendant au moins trois ans, de fournir à tout tiers, à un tarif qui ne soit pas supérieur à ce que vous coûte l'acte physique de réaliser une distribution source, une copie intégrale du code source correspondant sous une forme lisible par un ordinateur, qui sera distribuée au titre des termes des Articles 1 et 2 ci-dessus, sur un support habituellement utilisé pour l'échange de logiciels; ou,

c) L'accompagner des informations reçues par vous concernant la proposition de distribution du code source correspondant. (Cette solution n'est autorisée que dans le cas d'une distribution non commerciale et seulement si vous avez reçu le programme sous forme de code objet ou d'exécutable accompagné d'une telle proposition - en conformité avec le sous-Article b ci-dessus.)

Le code source d'un ouvrage désigne la forme favorite pour travailler à des modifications de cet ouvrage. Pour un ouvrage exécutable, le code source intégral désigne la totalité du code source de la totalité des modules qu'il contient, ainsi que les éventuels fichiers de définition des interfaces qui y sont associés, ainsi que les scripts utilisés pour contrôler la compilation et l'installation de l'exécutable. Cependant, par exception spéciale, le code source distribué n'est pas censé inclure quoi que ce soit de normalement distribué (que ce soit sous forme source ou binaire) avec les composants principaux (compilateur, noyau, et autre) du système d'exploitation sur lequel l'exécutable tourne, à moins que ce composant lui-même n'accompagne l'exécutable.

Si distribuer un exécutable ou un code objet consiste à offrir un accès permettant leur copie depuis un endroit particulier, alors l'offre d'un accès équivalent pour copier le code source depuis le même endroit compte comme une distribution du code source - même si les tiers ne sont pas contraints de copier le source en même temps que le code objet.

4. Vous ne pouvez copier, modifier, concéder en sous-licence, ou distribuer le Programme, sauf tel qu'expressément prévu par la présente Licence. Toute tentative de copier, modifier, concéder en sous-licence, ou distribuer le Programme d'une autre manière est réputée non valable, et met immédiatement fin à vos droits au titre de la présente Licence. Toutefois, les tiers ayant reçu de vous des copies, ou des droits, au titre de la présente Licence ne verront pas leurs autorisations résiliées aussi longtemps que ledits tiers se conforment pleinement à elle.

5. Vous n'êtes pas obligé d'accepter la présente Licence étant donné que vous ne l'avez pas signée. Cependant, rien d'autre ne vous accorde l'autorisation de modifier ou distribuer le Programme ou les ouvrages fondés sur lui. Ces actions sont interdites par la loi si vous n'acceptez pas la présente Licence. En conséquence, en modifiant ou distribuant le Programme (ou un ouvrage quelconque fondé sur le Programme), vous signifiez votre acceptation de la présente Licence en le faisant, et de toutes ses conditions concernant la copie, la distribution ou la modification du Programme ou d'ouvrages fondés sur lui.

6. Chaque fois que vous redistribuez le Programme (ou n'importe quel ouvrage fondé sur le Programme), une licence est automatiquement concédée au destinataire par le concédant originel de la licence, l'autorisant à copier, distribuer ou modifier le Programme, sous réserve des présentes conditions. Vous ne pouvez imposer une quelconque limitation supplémentaire à l'exercice des droits octroyés au titre des présentes par le destinataire. Vous n'avez pas la responsabilité d'imposer le respect de la présente Licence à des tiers.

7. Si, conséquement à une décision de justice ou l'allégation d'une transgression de brevet ou pour toute autre raison (non limitée à un probleme de brevet), des obligations vous sont imposées (que ce soit par jugement, conciliation ou autre) qui contredisent les conditions de la présente Licence, elles ne vous excusent pas des conditions de la présente Licence. Si vous ne pouvez distribuer de manière à satisfaire simultanément vos obligations au titre de la présente Licence et toute autre obligation pertinente, alors il en découle que vous ne pouvez pas du tout distribuer le Programme. Par exemple, si une licence de brevet ne permettait pas une redistribution sans redevance du Programme par tous ceux qui reçoivent une copie directement ou indirectement par votre intermédiaire, alors la seule façon pour vous de satisfaire à la fois à la licence du brevet et à la présente Licence serait de vous abstenir totalement de toute distribution du Programme.

Si une partie quelconque de cet article est tenue pour nulle ou inopposable dans une circonstance particulière quelconque, l'intention est que le reste de l'article s'applique. La totalité de la section s'appliquera dans toutes les autres circonstances.

Cet article n'a pas pour but de vous induire à transgresser un quelconque brevet ou d'autres revendications à un droit de propriété ou à contester la validité de la moindre de ces revendications ; cet article a pour seul objectif de protéger l'intégrité du système de distribution du logiciel libre, qui est mis en oeuvre par la pratique des licenses publiques. De nombreuses personnes ont fait de généreuses contributions au large spectre de logiciels distribués par ce système en se fiant à l'application cohérente de ce système ; il appartient à chaque auteur/donateur de décider si il ou elle veut distribuer du logiciel par l'intermédiaire d'un quelconque autre système et un concessionaire ne peut imposer ce choix.

Cet article a pour but de rendre totalement limpide ce que l'on pense être une conséquence du reste de la présente Licence.

8. Si la distribution et/ou l'utilisation du Programme est limitée dans certains pays que ce soit par des brevets ou par des interfaces soumises au droit d'auteur, le titulaire originel des droits d'auteur qui décide de couvrir le Programme par la présente Licence peut ajouter une limitation géographique de distribution explicite qui exclue ces pays afin que la distribution soit permise seulement dans ou entre les pays qui ne sont pas ainsi exclus. Dans ce cas, la présente Licence incorpore la limitation comme si elle était écrite dans le corps de la présente Licence.

9. La Free Software Foundation peut, de temps à autre, publier des versions révisées et/ou nouvelles de la Licence Publique Générale. De telles nouvelles versions seront similaires à la présente version dans l'esprit mais pourront différer dans le détail pour prendre en compte de nouvelles problématiques ou inquiétudes.

Chaque version possède un numéro de version la distinguant. Si le Programme précise le numéro de version de la présente Licence qui s'y applique et "une version ultérieure quelconque", vous avez le choix de suivre les conditions de la présente version ou de toute autre version ultérieure publiée par la Free Software Foundation. Si le Programme ne spécifie aucun numéro de version de la présente Licence, vous pouvez choisir une version quelconque publiée par la Free Software Foundation à quelque moment que ce soit.

10. Si vous souhaitez incorporer des parties du Programme dans d'autres programmes libres dont les conditions de distribution sont différentes, écrivez à l'auteur pour lui en demander l'autorisation. Pour les logiciels dont la Free Software Foundation est titulaire des droits d'auteur, écrivez à la Free Software Foundation ; nous faisons parfois des exceptions dans ce sens. Notre décision sera guidée par le double objectif de préserver le statut libre de tous les dérivés de nos logiciels libres et de promouvoir le partage et la réutilisation des logiciels en général.
ABSENCE DE GARANTIE

VOUS ASSUMEZ LA TOTALITE DES RISQUES LIES A LA QUALITE ET AUX PERFORMANCES DU PROGRAMME. SI LE PROGRAMME SE REVELAIT DEFECTUEUX, LE COUT DE L'ENTRETIEN, DES REPARATIONS OU DES CORRECTIONS NECESSAIRES VOUS INCOMBENT INTEGRALEMENT.

12. EN AUCUN CAS, SAUF LORSQUE LA LOI APPLICABLE OU UNE CONVENTION ECRITE L'EXIGE, UN TITULAIRE DE DROIT D'AUTEUR QUEL QU'IL SOIT, OU TOUTE PARTIE QUI POURRAIT MODIFIER ET/OU REDISTRIBUER LE PROGRAMME COMME PERMIS CI-DESSUS, NE POURRAIT ETRE TENU POUR RESPONSABLE A VOTRE EGARD DES DOMMAGES, INCLUANT LES DOMMAGES GENERIQUES, SPECIFIQUES, SECONDAIRES OU CONSECUTIFS, RESULTANT DE L'UTILISATION OU DE L'INCAPACITE D'UTILISER LE PROGRAMME (Y COMPRIS, MAIS SANS Y ETRE LIMITE, LA PERTE DE DONNEES, OU LE FAIT QUE DES DONNEES SOIENT RENDUES IMPRECISES, OU LES PERTES EPROUVEES PAR VOUS OU PAR DES TIERS, OU LE FAIT QUE LE PROGRAMME ECHOUE A INTEROPERER AVEC UN AUTRE PROGRAMME QUEL QU'IL SOIT) MEME SI LE DIT TITULAIRE DU DROIT D'AUTEUR OU LE PARTIE CONCERNEE A ETE AVERTI DE L'EVENTUALITE DE TELS DOMMAGES.
FIN DES CONDITIONS
Comment appliquer ces conditions à vos nouveaux programmes

Si vous développez un nouveau programme, et si vous voulez qu'il soit de la plus grande utilité possible pour le public, le meilleur moyen d'y parvenir est d'en faire un logiciel libre que chacun peut redistribuer et modifier au titre des présentes conditions.

Pour ce faire, munissez le programme des avis qui suivent. Le plus sûr est de les ajouter au début de chaque fichier source pour véhiculer le plus efficacement possible l'absence de toute garantie ; chaque fichier devrait aussi contenir au moins la ligne "copyright" et une indication de l'endroit où se trouve l'avis complet.

[Une ligne donnant le nom du programme et une courte idée de ce qu'il fait.] Copyright (C) [année] [nom de l'auteur] Ce programme est un logiciel libre ; vous pouvez le redistribuer et/ou le modifier au titre des clauses de la Licence Publique Générale GNU, telle que publiée par la Free Software Foundation ; soit la version 2 de la Licence, ou (à votre discrétion) une version ultérieure quelconque. Ce programme est distribué dans l'espoir qu'il sera utile, mais SANS AUCUNE GARANTIE ; sans même une garantie implicite de COMMERCIABILITE ou DE CONFORMITE A UNE UTILISATION PARTICULIERE. Voir la Licence Publique Générale GNU pour plus de détails. Vous devriez avoir reçu un exemplaire de la Licence Publique Générale GNU avec ce programme ; si ce n'est pas le cas, écrivez à la Free Software Foundation Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA.

Ajoutez aussi des informations sur la manière de vous contacter par courrier électronique et courrier postal.

Si le programme est interactif, faites en sorte qu'il affiche un court avis tel que celui-ci lorsqu'il démarre en mode interactif :

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) année nom de l'auteur Gnomovision n'est accompagné d'ABSOLUMENT AUCUNE GARANTIE ; pour plus de détails tapez "show w". Ceci est un logiciel libre et vous êtes invité à le redistribuer en respectant certaines obligations ; pour plus de détails tapez "show c".

Les instructions hypothétiques "show w" et "show c" sont supposées montrer les parties ad hoc de la Licence Publique Générale. Bien entendu, les instructions que vous utilisez peuvent porter d'autres noms que "show w" et "show c" ; elles peuvent même être des clics de souris ou des éléments d'un menu ou tout ce qui convient à votre programme.

Vous devriez aussi obtenir de votre employeur (si vous travaillez en tant que développeur) ou de votre école, si c'est le cas, qu'il (ou elle) signe une "renonciation aux droits d'auteur" concernant le programme, si nécessaire. Voici un exemple (changez les noms) :

Yoyodyne, Inc., déclare par la présente renoncer à toute prétention sur les droits d'auteur du programme "Gnomovision" (qui fait des avances aux compilateurs) écrit par James Hacker. [signature de Ty Coon], 1er avril 1989 Ty Coon, Président du Vice

La présente Licence Publique Générale n'autorise pas l'incorporation de votre programme dans des programmes propriétaires. Si votre programme est une bibliothèque de sous-programmes, vous pouvez considérer plus utile d'autoriser l'édition de liens d'applications propriétaires avec la bibliothèque. Si c'est ce que vous voulez faire, utilisez la GNU Lesser General Public License au lieu de la présente Licence.
